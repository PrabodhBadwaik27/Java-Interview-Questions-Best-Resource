# Java Interview Questions Best Resource  
Here are the best answers for the most popular Java questions asked in interviews.  
**Pre-requisites:** Basic Java Programming, Object Oriented Concepts.  
**Expertise:** FRESHERS and EXPERIENCED PROFESSIONALS  

## Object Oriented Programming Concepts  

#### 1. What are the advantages of OOP?
- OOP contributes to the development the special features namely **Inheritence**, **Encapsulation**, **Abstraction** and **Polymorphism**. The advantages of OOP are:  
  - enhances the reusability   
  - improves the readability of program  
  - follows the modular approach of development of program which helps in collaborating with distributed teams  
  - also, modular approach eases the process of modification and maintainance of code 
  - appreciates the flexibility and reliability of code
  
#### 2. Explain Encapsulation.  
- Encapsulation is the concept of **restricting or hiding the internal characteristics** of a certain class from the other objects.  
- In order to accelerate the power of encapsulation, Java implements 4 types of access modifiers which differentiates the accessibility of their members and objects from out of the class. The access modifiers are, **public**, **protected**, **default** and **private**.
- Advantages of encapsulation are:
  - encapsulation fuels the approach of modularity of a program
  - it helps in reusability of code and hence emphasize on the *DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle* of programming.
  - thus, the modification and maintainibility costs are reduced significantly
  - overall, encapsulation adds up to the flexibility of any program
